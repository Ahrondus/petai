It is just a framework for other mods to make creating pets more easy. Most pets will be able to receive commands by the player. To give your pet a command, you need to crouch right click on it. A small GUI will open containing the various commands your pet will accept. But be aware, as your pet will only execute commands if you are a good pet owner. That generally means feeding your pet regularly, but can also be expanded to engaging in playful activities with it.\n\nPet AI currently supports four different aggression levels for pets:\n<strong>Passive:</strong> Your pet won't harm anybody.\n<strong>Neutral:</strong> Your pet will only attack if provoked.\n<strong>Protective:</strong> Your pet will fight along your side, it will defend you from evil creatures and hunt down your victims.\n<strong>Aggressive:</strong> Your pet will attack a small selection of creatures on its own.\n\nIf you feel the urge to try and remote control your pet, check out the pet whistle. It also makes your pet more useful when hunting."
